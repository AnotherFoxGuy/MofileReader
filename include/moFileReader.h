  * 
  *
  * <h2>Compilation with Visual C++ (Express and better)</h2>
  *
  * We provide a project for Visual C++ 2008. You can select 3 Types of Compilation:
  *
  * <h3>Executable (Release or Debug)</h3>
  *
  * This will compile the code as an executable which can lookup strings from every .mo-File you load with it.
  * This can be handy if you want to have a peek into a file or test something etc. I recommend building the 
  * release-executable only if you just want to use it.
  *
  * <h3>Dynamic Loaded Library ( ReleaseDLL )</h3>
  *
  * This may be overkill, but perhaps you like it modular. This Configuration will create a dll and an import-library.
  * Do not forget to link against the import-library and please define MOFILE_IMPORT in your preprocessor-settings, 
  *  otherwise you will receive a bunch of linker-errors. 
  * You will find all files in the directory "lib" in the Solutions Directory.
  *
  * <h3>Static Library ( ReleaseLIB )</h3>
  *
  * This will compile the code as a static library with no Entry-Point. This is the recommended usage. 
  * But please do not forget to link against moFileReader.static.lib. Otherwise you will receive linker-errors.
  *
  * <h2>Compilation via cmake</h2>
  *
  * - Make sure you have cmake installed and in your path. If not, go to http://www.cmake.org and get it. 
  * - Switch to a Shell or commandline
  * - Run cmake in $INSTALLDIR\\build. See cmake --help for possible generators. Here are the available Options:
  *     - COMPILE_DLL Setting this to ON will compile the library as a shared module. By default, a static library is built.
  *     .
  *   Example:
  *   \code
  *   cmake -G"MinGW Makefiles" -DCOMPILE_DLL=ON
  *   cmake -G"Visual Studio 9 2008"
  *   // etc
  *   \endcode
  *
  * cmake will compile the library and moReader[.exe]-binary, which can do lookups in moFiles and export moFiles as HTML.
  * See moReader[.exe] --help for details. 
  * You will find the libraries in %%projectdir%%/lib and the binary in %%projectdir%%/bin
  *
  * <h2>Compilation via provided batch-files (woe32 only)</h2>
  *
  * - Call compile_vc.bat or compile_mingw.bat with one of these options:
  *     - DLL - Compiles as dynamic loaded module.
  *     - LIB - Compiles as static library.
  *     - EXE - Compiles the executable.
  *
  * <h2>None of those?</h2>
  *
  * The last option is to simply add moFileReader.cpp, moFileReader.h and moFileConfig.h to your project. Thats all you have to do. 
  * You can safely exclude mo.cpp, since this file keeps the entry-points of the .exe and .dll only.
  *
  * <h2>Usage</h2>
  *
  * This is moFileReader, a simple gettext-replacement. The usage of this library is, hopefully, fairly simple:
  * \code
  *
  * // Instanciate the class
  * moFileLib::moFileReader reader;
  *
  * // Load a .mo-File.
  * if ( reader.ReadFile("myTranslationFile.mo") != moFileLib::moFileReader::EC_SUCCESS )
  * {
  *    // Error Handling
  * }
  *
  * // Now, you can lookup the strings you stored in the .mo-File:
  * std::cout << reader.Lookup("MyTranslationString") << std::endl;  
  *
  * \endcode
  * Thats all! This small code has no dependencies, except the C/C++-runtime of your compiler,
  * so it should work on all machines where a C++-runtime is provided.
  *
  * \note We do not yet support .mo-Files with reversed magic-numbers, since I don't have
  *       a file to test it and I hate to release stuff I wasn't able to test. 
  *       If you can provide such a file with reversed bytes, please compile %%projectdir%%/bin/i18n/de/moTest.po with
  *       gettext or poEdit and send it to scorcher24 [at] gmail [dot] com.
  *
  * <h2>Changelog</h2>
  * 
  * - Version 0.1.2
  *     - Generic improvements to the documentation.
  *     - Generic improvements to the code
  *     - Fixed a bug in mo.cpp which caused the application not to print the help
  *       message if only --export or --lookup where missing.
  *     - Added -h, --help and -? to moReader[.exe]. It will print the help-screen.
  *     - Added --version and -v to moReader[.exe]. It will print some informations about the program.
  *     - Added --license to moReader[.exe]. This will print its license. 
  *     - --export gives now a feedback about success or failure.   
  *     - The HTML-Dump-Method outputs now the whole table from the empty msgid in a nice html-table, not only a few hardcoded. 
  *     - I had an issue-report that the Error-Constants can collide with foreign code under certain conditions, 
  *       so I added a patch which renamed the error-constants to more compatible names. 
  *
  * - Version 0.1.1
  *     - Added the ability to export mo's as HTML.
  *     - Fixed a bug causing a crash when passing an invalid value to moFileReader::Lookup().
  *     - Added a new file, moFileConfig.h, holding the macros for the project.
  *     - Added the ability to be configured by cmake.
  *     - Added some more inline-functions, which really enhance the singleton.
  *
  * - Version 0.1.0
  *     - Initial Version and release to http://googlecode.com
